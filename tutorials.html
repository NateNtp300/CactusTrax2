            <div class="header">Begginners guide on music production</div>  
            <div class="info">
              <div>This is an in order list of what new music producers should learn. This is mostly for hobbyists but also a great starting point for
                  those who want to make a career in music production.  </div>

              <div>
                <h2>Step 1: Choose your digital audio workstation</h2>
                A digital audio workstation is simply the software that is used to make music and it is mostly used by EDM producers.
                There are free ones and there are also paid ones. Many of the paid ones also have free trials that users can experience first
                to decide if they want to purchase it. Some of the most popular paid digital audio workstations are FL studio, Abelton, Cubase,
                and Logic. The paid ones come with more and better tools, so I would suggest one of them. Some of the free ones are Garageband 
                and LMS but do not expect to make anything to substantial with them. For a begginner I beleive the best digital audio workstation you 
                can get is FL studio because of the simple user interface and it is the most used so there is much more information about it 
                on the internet. I will be doing my guides on FL studio.  Purchasing the producers edition is the best because it comes with 
                all the basic tools that a begginner will need. <a href = "https://www.image-line.com/">Click here to go to the website to
                buy FL studio.</a>
            </div>

              <div>
                <h2>Step 2: Composition </h2>
                After you get familiar with how to use a digital audio workstation you have to learn composition, which means writing music.
                You do not have to be a music theory expert to write music but it can help the more you know. In my video I will explain how
                to write music for the EDM genre. In EDM and the various subgenres the music is usually written in a minor scale. Some genres
                like UK hardcore are written in major scales often, however. 
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 3: Mixing </h2>
                Mixing is all about making the music sound better by using various tools and techniques. I will be going over all the different effects that
                can be added to sounds to make them sound better. These topics are difficult to explain in words so my videos and other videos
                on the internet will best explain mixing.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 3.1: Equalization </h2>
                I would say equalization is the most important mixing tool. This is because it is used to make all the different sounds in the track
                blend well together. The more different sounds you have in a song, the more important equalization becomes. All sounds are made up
                of frequencies and equalization is about manipulating the frequencies so the different sounds fit together better.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 3.2: Compression </h2>
               Compression is also one of the mixing techniques that make sounds fit better in a track. It is used to make sounds seem louder 
               and come out more to the listener. I will explain this in the video but in technical terms what compression does is reduce the 
               dynamic range of a sound and then boost the overall volume so that all the frequencies in that sound are heard better.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 3.3: Reverb </h2>
                Reverb is an effect that gives sounds an atmospheric type feel. It is usually used on chords and melodies. It is difficult to
                desribe how it sounds so in the video you will hear what reverb sounds like.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 3.4: Sidechaining </h2>
                Sidechaining is used to make the kick and snare sound come out better in the mix. You will notice that if your mix has many 
                different sounds in it the kick and snare, but especially the kick, will not be heard very well. That is because of all of the 
                other frequencies interfering in the mix. So sidechaining quickly lowers the volume when the kick or snare hit to correct this.
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Step 4.0: Upgrading your plugins </h2>
                After experimenting around with production and realizing you like it enough to continue, it is time to upgrade to better plugins.
                You can make much better sounding music with good plugins. The top 3 synthesizer plugins that me and other producers would reccommend
                are Serum, Sylenth, and Massive. Serum is the most modern and is used to make riddim and future bass music. It can be used to make
                the extreme bass sounds you hear in riddim and the chords you hear in future bass. If you want to make more oldschool type edm from
                2008-2013 then your best bet is to get Sylenth and Massive. Massive is used to make many of the original dubstep bass sounds. It is 
                what Skrillex and Virtual riot use. Sylenth makes very nice chord sounds and comes with a big library of useful presets. Martin Garrix
                has been known to frequently use Sylenth.

            <div>
                <h2>Step 4.1: Upgrading your samples </h2>
                The samples that come with the digital audio workstations are not always the best. The ones I would suggest to get first that have
                some great sounds in it are 
                <a href = "https://www.vengeance-sound.com/samples.php">Vengeance essential club sounds vol. 4</a>, 
                <a href = "https://www.vengeance-sound.com/samples.php">Vengeance essential dubstep vol. 1</a>, 
                <a href = "https://cymatics.fm/collections/store">Cymatics Freebies - drum samples and loops</a>,
                <a href = "https://splice.com/sounds/splice/sounds-of-kshmr-vol-1">Sounds of KSHMR vol. 1</a>, 
                <a href = "https://splice.com/sounds/splice/sounds-of-kshmr-vol-1">Sounds of KSHMR vol. 2</a>. 
                These ones have great drum sounds and other various sounds that I find myslef using them the most.
                After these you can get other sample packs from these developers or research different ones that you may want.
