            <div class="info">
              <div>These are my articles I've written on Music Theory. I hope they're easy to understand and that the readers can hopefully glean at least a few useful things from them.  </div>

              <div>
                <h2>Music Theory- What It Is, Is Not, and Should I Learn It?</h2>
               <p>As an EDM producer, you’ve probably heard the term “Music Theory” come up. Maybe you yourself consider knowledgeable on music theory, maybe you know a lot, maybe you know very little, maybe you think you know very little at all.</p><p>
	<p>	Before we answer the question of “Should I learn Music Theory?” First, we’ll explore what music theory actually is. I believe that much of the population misunderstands what music theory is, perhaps because they had a bad experience with someone from a more academized music genre such as jazz or classical. So what is Music Theory exactly? We’re going to start off with wikipedia’s definition because I like it a lot- “Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.”. Notice how this definition does not include “The written analysis of European Classical Music based on functional harmony” </p>
	<p>If you’ve decided to look up Wikipedia’s article on Music Theory because it’s going to be far better researched and written than mine, you’ll notice the very next sentence cites the Oxford Companion to Music gives three different uses for music theory “The first is the "rudiments", that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation); the second is learning scholars views on music from antiquity to the present; the third a sub-topic of musicology that "seeks to define processes and general principles in music". “. Notice very carefully the first definition that mentions key signatures and the other things. This may be what you think of when you think of the term “Music Theory”. I believe that only seeing music theory by this definition is very dangerous. Not only is it an incredibly Euro-centric view on music, but learning only this type of theory can be incredibly un-useful to practitioners of other musical forms. There is no single “Music Theory”. Different cultures have different music theories. Jazz musicians think differently than Classical musicians, and these musicians think very differently from Arab or Indian musicians. </p>
	<p>Even academized Music Theory changes over time. In the 50’s a man named George Russell devised a system to understand  “Lydian Chromatic Concept” that asserted that music revolved around the Lydian mode. This concept was helpful to jazz musicians who wanted to improvise. Very few conservatories still teach the Lydian Chromatic Concept, instead Chord-Scales are now the norm for musicians hoping to learn to improvise in the jazz style.  It is unimportant for you to know what the Lydian mode is or what a chord-scale is, just that these are two competing analyses of jazz.
	Wait a minute, if there are two major competing theories on jazz which one is correct. The answer is neither and both. Music Theory is only an analysis that helps us seek to try to understand the music that is created. Obviously music came before musical analysis. There is no single correct music theory to analyze music. If you are familiar with Literature, Art, Economics, etc. you are probably aware there are multiple competing theories on how to analyze things. It’s the exact same thing with music. </p>
	<p>What Im really trying to get at is that music theory may not be what you think it is, and that you probably know more music theory than you think. The idea of a “bass drop” is music theory. If you are discussing music with someone else and trying to explain what you hear, you are doing a music theory. The idea of a “bass drop” is music theory Just because you’re not going to read about it in any college music textbooks (you can probably find an example contradicting this, but just roll with it for now) does not mean it is not music theory. Practitioners of more modern musical forms have their own language and analysis for the music that they’re creating. Perhaps in 50 years or so you’ll be able to major in college in EDM music because someone might create some theory of EDM that academia latches on to. </p>
	<p>I know I have ranted and raved against using European Classical Music Theory as the be all and  end all of music theory. In the coming articles Im going to be discussing… a lot of European Classical Music Theory… but I will be approaching these topics from a descriptive side instead of a prescriptive side. I won’t use terms like “good” or “ bad” and I will try to avoid using music notation and instead use the piano roll to illustrate musical concepts. I will also discuss the origins of music and different cultural perspectives when I can.</p>

                <h2>What are scales?</h2>

          
	<p>Scales are everywhere in music, but what exactly is a scale? If you ask a musician to play a C major scale, they’ll probably play the notes C D E F G A B C in ascedning order and maybe descending order. So is a scale a set of notes played in ascending and/or descending order? Yes and no, If I ask you to play a scale, what Im implying is that you should play every note of the scale in order, but scales are bigger than just a series of notes.</p>
	<p>It’s probably more useful to think of a scale as a pool of notes from which we derive other musical concepts. Imagine a keyboard or the piano roll. The space in between two successive notes is called a half step. The space between two notes is called a whole step. Why is one called a half step and one a whole step? I really don’t think there’s a good reason it’s just nomenclature. Perhaps there’s a reason that relates to Just Intonation but we won’t be exploring that concept for a long time. </p>
	<p>The most common scale we see today is the major scale. Every major scale uses the same pattern of whole steps and half steps. That pattern is W – W – H – W – W – W – H where W equals whole step and H equals half step. You can continue this pattern up or back down forever, repeating it again and again. You can pick any note you want on the keyboard and build the major scale from it. Let’s build a C major scale from this example. We start from C and go a whole step up with gives us D, go another whole step up and we get E, go another up and we get F, and so on we get G, A ,B ,C. So the notes in a C major scale are C D E F G A B C. These just so happen to be the white keys. There is nothing special musically about white keys versus black keys, it’s just the way keyboards are laid out. There is nothing inherently special or basic about C major other than the way we understand it.</p>
	 <p>Moving forward, if we start at A and follow this pattern we get A B C# D E F# G# A. These two scales are functionally indistinguishable, the starting pitches matter less to us than the pattern of steps that we followed. If you’ve ever seen one of those charts discussing the saddest or happiest keys, those are meaningless. In our current system, every key is functionally the same. Now that we understand that every major scale is equivalent let’s move forward.</p>
	Every note of a scale has a function. If we want to get fancy we can call these notes by their fancy names the tonic, the supertonic, the mediant, the subdominant, the dominant, the submediant, the subtonic, the leading tone, and once again the tonic. Note how the tonic appears twice, this is due to what we call octave equivalency. We as humans recognize notes that are double in pitch, or half in pitch of the original note, as equivalent. A =440, A = 880, A = 220, etc. We can label these notes also by number 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th,6th, 7th, 1st. Or by a system named solfege. Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do.  I will be using solfege because I think it will lead to the least confusion moving forward.</p> 
	<p>Sing the major scale out loud, it does not matter what you pick your starting note as. Sing Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do. Sing along with a piano if you have to and pluck out any major scale you like, C major is the easiest to play on a piano. Get a feeling for each note of the scale. Now sing Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti- and don’t sing the final Do. Your probably think this sounds incomplete, and that’s because our 7th note, Ti, also known as the leading tone, wants to lead back to Do. This does not mean it is better to go to Do, only that the note wants to go to Do. You do not have to go to Do, it can be musically pleasing to go to a different note. But when you don’t go to Do, you are playing with musical expectations. This is the basis for what is the beginning of the basis for what we call functional harmony, and if you make EDM, you cannot escape it whether you like it or not. It’s just the way we’ve been trained to hear music since birth.</p>
	When we pick a scale to use and make music with it, we call that the “key” If we make music with the C major scale, our home note is C and our key is also called C major. Does that mean you can’t play other notes from outside the scale? Of course not, you can always play any notes you want, the music police aren’t going to come arrest you. We call notes from inside the scale diatonic, and notes from outside it chromatic. C is diatonic in the C major scale, but C is chromatic in the A major scale.</p>
	<p>Of course 90% of this article was about the major scale in particular, but there are many other scales to choose from such as minor or any of the other musical modes. I will cover what musical modes are in a later article. There are some special cases for scales I may cover in the future, such as scales played differently ascending or descending or scales that span more than a single octave.</p>

                <h2>Just Like Cereal, Intervals Can be Generic</h2>
	<p>This next article is going to be about intervals and the two types we have when discussing them. Remember in the last article how I said 1 note away was a half step, and 2 notes away were whole steps. As you probably know, there are intervals bigger than just two notes. 1 half step is the minor second, 2 is the major second, 3 is the minor third, 4 is the major third, 5 is the perfect 4th, 6 is the tritone, 7 is the perfect 5th, 8 is the minor 6th, 9 is the major 6th, 10 is the minor seventh, 11 is the major 7th, 12 is the octave. Sometimes we go further than the octave and save 13 is the minor ninth and 14 is the major ninth. This is mostly a jazz convention where they use chords with the intervals of the 9th in them but we won’t pay much attention to the 9th in these articles because if you lower them one octave, theyre just the minor and major second. 
	<p>You can play intervals going up, down, or at the same time. C up to E is a major 3rd, C going down to E is a major 3rd, and C and E played at the same time is a major 3rd. These will all sound different but theyre all the same interval.</p>
	<p>Why are some of these intervals minor, major or perfect? That doesn’t matter right now, but please note that minor, major, and perfect should not be used as descriptors for their sounds. Especially do not be deceived by thinking major = happy :) and minor = sad :( . I’m sure you’re all familiar with Beethoven’s 5th symphony if you need to be reminded just look it up and listen to the first three notes. It’s two notes that are the same and then a note a major 3rd down. Does that major third sound happy? Absolutely not. The truth is that the way intervals sound depends completely on their context. Is the interval part of a chord? Is the interval ascending or descending? What are the other intervals surrounding it? Is the passage diatonic or chromatic? These things and many others can all contribute to the ways intervals feel. Even in classical music we treat the perfect 4th as sometimes being consonant, and sometimes being dissonant. In jazz music there are many sounds that jazz listeners have come to accept as consonant that classical composers would consider dissonant and want to resolve. Always make sure you decide for yourself what an interval is sounding like in that moment and don’t depend on a music theory text book to tell you what you’re hearing.</p>
	<p>What we’ve been discussing are called specific intervals. We also have a concept called generic intervals and it’s important to know the distinction between the two. Pick a scale, any scale will work, but we’ll use major again. Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti. Going from one note to the next is a 2nd. Do to Re is a second, Sol to La is a second, Ti to La is a second. If we go two notes away instead of one, these are our 3rds. Do to Mi is a third and so is Re to Fa. These are generic intervals, they are not bound by our specific intervals. Do to Mi happens to be a major 3rd, Re to Fa is a minor 3rd. Their specific intervals have no bearing on what the generic intervals are called. The harmonic minor scale happens to have an instance of some naming strangeness. It contains a 4th that happens to be a major 3rd. Generic intervals list scales steps only, so don’t confuse them with specific interval names.</p>

                <h2>Introduction to Chords</h2>
		<p>We now have the requisite knowledge to discuss chords. What is a chord? Most people consider chords to be 3 or more distinct notes played at the same time.  </p>
		<p>We now have the requisite knowledge to discuss chords. What is a chord? Most people consider chords to be 3 or more distinct notes played at the same time. 
	We’ll start out with three note chords, which are called triads. Triads are usually built by stacking generic thirds. Let’s take our major scale which I hope you’ve sang enough to have it be part of you at this point. Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti. If you were able to sing Do Mi and Fa, at the same time you would get what is called a major chord. Re Fa and La form a minor chord. Mi, Sol, and Ti form a minor chord. Fa, La, and Do form a Major chord. Sol, Ti, and Re form a major chord. La, Do, and Mi form a minor chord. Ti, Re, and Fa form a diminished chord. Together these chords are called the diatonic triads (diatonic meaning from the key) Since we’ve already been over intervals I can tell you a major chord is a major third and a perfect fifth from the root. A minor chord is a minor third and a perfect fifth. Finally a diminished is a minor third and a diminished fifth (a tritone). There are not the only chords that exist but it’s a good start.</p>
 <p>In a major scale we give these chords names based on roman numerals- I ii iii IV V vi vii°. Capital letters denote major, lowercase denotes minor, and the degree symbol denotes diminished. I is called your tonic chord the same way the origin of the scale is called the tonic. When you play chords in a sequence it’s called a chord progression. There are many different chord progressions and most of them lead back to I. Go to the piano and experiment with moving from one chord to the next, any ones you like. How does it make you feel? Do some chords seem to want to go to other chords? Which chords sound the most stable or unstable? I could try to tell you my own beliefs on it but this is something you should figure out for yourself as we want music to be a personal language of expression.</p>

 <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p>
This is all the music theory Im going to cover for now, but I hope this has piqued your curiosity and maybe you’ll decide to dive down further. I also hope you’ll be able to protect yourself from people who claim to have some sort of truth about music. There is no “one” music theory and there is  no “correct” way to think about music. That’s still not to say it can’t be useful to think in less ambiguous terms. Perhaps you’ll find a musician you admire and want to listen to their truth about music. That’s fine, but don’t ever think you have to learn some concept because some jazz or classical snob told you it was the right way. Enjoy your path as a musician, its a confusing but very rewarding one.</p>
